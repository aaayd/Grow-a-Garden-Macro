## 📦 Macro Setup

### 🔧 Gear and Seed Crafting Tab

To enable crafting automation, **check** the box labeled `Craft Gears/Seeds/Event`?. This allows the macro to automatically craft **any recipe** you want — including items like **Reclaimers**, **Lightning Rods**, or **Event Seeds**.

> ⚠️ **Important for Reclaimers**:
> If you have **Common Crates** in your inventory, they can interfere with the macro. It's recommended to **remove them** before crafting Reclaimers.

> 🍓 **Fruit Detection Tip**:
> For fruits required in the crafting menu, **make sure the “KG” text is visible** in your inventory. Essentially try to have unmuted fruits in your inventory so it can see the "KG" text.

### 🧬 Dino Machine Automation (Prehistoric Update!)

In the new **Prehistoric Update**, the macro now supports automation with the **DNA Machine**:

1. It will cycle through your **hotbar slots (excluding the 1st slot)** to use items on the DNA machine.
2. Once the hotbar is cleared, the macro enters the **Dog Bunny Lab** and **sells only those Common pets**.
3. So I recommend having a bunch of common pets in your inventory unfavorited so the macro and can use it for the DNA machine.
