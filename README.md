# 🍏 Grow a Garden Macro

A macro for **Grow a Garden** that automatically buys your selected seeds, gear, and even crafts gears and more!

✅ It works **anywhere**, even **outside** of Grow a Garden.

✅ Supports **auto-reconnect** and sends **images via Discord webhook**.

✅ The macro does NOT require **UI navigation** and the macro works using your cursor.

> **Important:** Make sure your **Recall Wrench** is in the **first hotbar slot**

---

## 🧪 Crafting & DNA Machine

The **Crafting tab** allows you to craft items automatically!
Make sure you have the **required materials** in your inventory — the macro will search and click them for you.

> ⚠️ If you're using fruits, ensure they are **not mutated**, or they will not be detected.

> ⚠️ If your crafting reclaimers, don't have common crates in your inventory or else the macro will accidently select them instead of Common Eggs.

The **DNA Machine** feature can be enabled to automatically convert pets to Dino Eggs.

**In your hotbar besides the 1st slot, place the pets you want to sacrifice in your hotbar.**
